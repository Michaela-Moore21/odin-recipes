        <li>Cook for 3-4 minutes per side or until browned. Cook in multiple batches if needed.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the pan and place on a plate lined with paper towels</li>

             and brown sugar to the pan and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Mix the 2 teaspoons of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon of cold water. Add the cornstarch to the sauce
             and bring to a boil; boil for 30-60 seconds until just thickened.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and green onions to the pan and toss to coat with the sauce. Serve over rice if
             desired.</li>
